                In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.
              The opposite of every other book. Don’t try. Give up. Be wrong. Lower your standards. Stop believing in yourself. Follow the pain. Each point is profoundly true, useful, and more powerful than the usual positivity. Succinct but surprisingly deep, I read it in one night.<br>

                Robert Kiyosaki’s Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published in 1997 and quickly became a must-read for people interested in investing, money, and the global economy. The book has been translated into dozens of languages, sold around the world, and has become the #1 Personal Finance book of all time.<br>
The overarching theme of Rich Dad Poor Dad is how to use money as a tool for wealth development. 

It destroys the myth that the rich are born rich, explains why your personal residence may not really be an asset, describes the real difference between an asset and a liability, and much more.

                 Make it Stick describes the prevalence of the “illusion of knowing” arising from ineffectual learning habits such as rereading and massed practice.
